    Working at a regional authority, I am able to work alongside agencies within our region. I particulary enjoy this because I
    get to see how other agencies operate. I have built  
    <a href="https://gtfs.org/" target = "_blank">GTFS feeds</a>
    for agencies which allows me to learn the ins and outs of their transit system. I also work to create system maps for them
    like the one below I made for Davidson County Transportation System (DCTS). I maintain an 
    <a href="https://part-nc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=37db432226c346cabb663688bdec4f8c" target="_blank">interactive web map</a>
    that is accessible from 
    <a href="https://www.co.davidson.nc.us/258/Transportation" target="_blank">DCTS' website</a>.
