  Working at a regional authority, I am able to assist agencies within our region. I particulary enjoy this because I get to see how 
  other agencies operate. Part of my work includes building a <a href="https://gtfs.org/" target = "_blank">GTFS</a> for the agency
  which allows me to learn the ins and outs of their transit system. I also get to create system maps for them like this one 
  I made for Davidson County Transportation System (DCTS). I maintain an 
  <a href="https://part-nc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=37db432226c346cabb663688bdec4f8c" target="_blank">interactive web map</a>
  that is accessible from 
  <a href="https://www.co.davidson.nc.us/258/Transportation" target="_blank">DCTS' website</a>.
