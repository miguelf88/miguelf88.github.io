  Working at a regional authority, I am able to assist smaller agencies. I particulary enjoy this because I get to see how 
  other agencies operate. Part of my work includes building a <a href="https://gtfs.org/" target = "_blank">GTFS</a> 
  which allows me to learn the ins and outs of their transit system. I also get to create system maps for them like this one 
  I made for Davidson County Transportation System (DCTS). TEST3
