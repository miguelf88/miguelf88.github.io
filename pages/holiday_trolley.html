    This is a simple web map I made for the Downtown Greensboro organization. They operated a holiday trolley during the Christmas
    season and asked PART if we could help design it. PART received the turn-by-turn directions from Downtown Greensboro and we drew
    the route in Remix. From there, I exported it out and brought it into ArcGIS Pro. Since it was a fairly simple map, I wanted
    to spice it up a bit. I drew the candy cane symbol in Adobe Illustrator, saved it as an SVG file, and loaded it into my GIS 
    as a custom symbol. This was the first time I had used a custom symbol on a map and it worked just as it should. Another 
    feature I had not used before was label classes. Using Arcade, Esri's expression language, I was able to select stops
    on either side of the route and display them differently. The images show those custom expressions. TEST4.
