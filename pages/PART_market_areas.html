<p>
        For a transit agency, a market area represents the geographic location that could access their service. This project 
        required me to delineate the market areas for PART. A Park &amp; Ride survey completed in mid-2018 helped me accomplish 
        this. Using a <a href="http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target = "_blank">free geocoder</a> from Texas A&amp;M University, 
        I mapped the home location of PART's passengers who completed the survey. I then calculated the Euclidean distance from each 
        home to the corresponding park &amp; ride lot. Using the interquartile range method, I removed outliers from the dataset.

        I located tables from the 2013-2017 5-year estimates of the American Community Survey using 
        <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml" target="_blank">American Fact Finder</a>.
        The tables were joined to a block group level geography from 
        <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/geographies/mapping-files.html" target="_blank">TIGER/Line shapefiles</a>
        using the GEOID as the field to join on.
