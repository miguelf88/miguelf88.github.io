        For a transit agency, a rideshed represents the geographic location from which passengers could access their service. 
        For PART, this includes park &amp; ride lots, transit terminals, or bus stops. The purpose of this project was to delineate
        the market areas for the PART system. A Park &amp; Ride survey completed in mid-2018 helped me accomplish 
        this task. I utilized a <a href="http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target = "_blank">free geocoder</a> from
        Texas A&amp;M University and I plotted the home location of PART's passengers by which park &amp; ride facility they parked
        their car. The results were circular shapes around urban park &amp; ride facilities while more rural lots were fan shaped.
        What we learned from this is that because urban lots are more central, they attract passengers from a wider area while the
        rural lots primarily had passengers coming from upstream. In the survery results there were very few examples of
        passengers traveling upstream to access a park &amp; lot.

        The next step was to analyze the demographics for the rideshed. For this, I located tables from the 2013-2017 5-year
        estimates of the American Community Survey using 
        <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml" target="_blank">American Fact Finder</a>.
        I brought the Census data into ArcGIS for geoprocessing. I then create a dashboard to display the demographpic data.

        When route planning, it is important to look at origin-destination data so the planner knows where people are coming from
        and going. <a href="https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/" target = "_blank">OnTheMap</a> is a great tool to use and download
        OD data from.
