        For a transit agency, a rideshed represents the geographic location from which passengers could access their service. 
        For PART, this includes park &amp; ride lots, transit terminals, or bus stops. The purpose of this project was to delineate
        the market areas for the PART system, analyze demographics inside each rideshed, and collect origin-destination data
        for each area. I wanted to create a series of dashboards to view the data and I embedded each dashboard into an ArcGIS
        Story Map. The final product is at the bottom of this page.

        The first step in this project was to identify the rideshed for each park &amp; lot. We had just completed a park &amp;
        ride survey completed in mid-2018. I utilized a 
        <a href="http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target = "_blank">free geocoder</a> 
        from Texas A&amp;M University and I plotted the home location of PART's passengers by which park &amp; ride facility they
        parked their car. The results were circular shapes around urban park &amp; ride facilities while more rural lots were fan
        shaped. What we learned from this is that because urban lots are more central, they attract passengers from a wider area
        while the rural lots primarily had passengers coming from upstream. In the survery results there were very few examples
        of passengers traveling upstream to access a park &amp; lot.

        The next step was to analyze the demographics for the rideshed. For this, I located tables from the 2013-2017 5-year
        estimates of the American Community Survey using 
        <a href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml" target="_blank">American Fact Finder</a>.
        I brought the Census data into ArcGIS Pro for geoprocessing. I then created a dashboard to display the demographpic data.
        This dashboard comes in handy when PART staff are writing grant applications and they need demographic figures for the
        entire PART system or an individual route.

        When route planning, it is important to look at origin-destination data so the planner knows where people are coming from
        and going. <a href="https://onthemap.ces.census.gov/" target = "_blank">OnTheMap</a> is a great tool to use and download
        OD data from. Each rideshed polygon was analyzed in OnTheMap and the results were exported and loaded into ArcGIS Pro. I
        created two dashboards located on the LEHD dashboards.
