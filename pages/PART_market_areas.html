<p>For a transit agency, a market area represents the geographic location that could access their service. This project 
required me to delineate the market areas for PART. A Park &amp; Ride survey completed in mid-2018 helped me accomplish 
this. Using a <a href="http://geoservices.tamu.edu/Services/Geocode/" target = "_blank">free geocoder</a> from Texas A&amp;M University, 
I mapped the home location of PART's passengers who filled out the survey. I then calculated the Euclidean distance from each 
home to the corresponding park &amp; ride lot. I then removed outliers using the interquartile range method.</p>
