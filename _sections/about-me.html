<p>
    I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a concentration
    in Geographic Information Systems. I work as a Transportation Planner with the Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation
    (PART). Most of my work focuses on data analysis and visualization using GIS as well as a few nifty tools I've put together
    in Excel. I've been working with Python for six months to help with my data analysis. I really enjoy getting down in the
    weeds with big data sets and being able to extract information that is used to solve an issue. I am able to quickly adapt in
    new environments and have consistently managed projects and delivered results on time.
