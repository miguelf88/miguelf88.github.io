<p>
    I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 2018 summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a
    concentration in Geographic Information Systems. I work as a Transportation Planner with the Piedmont Authority for
    Regional Transportation (PART). Most of my work focuses on data analysis and visualization using GIS as well as a few
    tools I've put together in Excel. I've recently been working with Python to help with my data analysis. I really
    enjoy getting down in the weeds with big data sets and being able to extract information that is used to solve an issue.
    I have consistently managed multiple projects while delivering results on time.
