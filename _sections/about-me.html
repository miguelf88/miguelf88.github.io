<p>I recently married my long-time girlfriend in December 2018. We live in Winston-Salem, North Carolina with your dog, Cass.
He's a nine year old Papillon that I personify into our little child. In May 2018, I graduated from the University of North 
Carolina at Greensboro summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a concentration in Geographic Information Systems.
 I currently work as a Transportation Planner. Most of my work focuses on data visualization using GIS as well as a few nifty 
tools I've put together in Excel. I'm currently learning Python to help with data visualization and to automate some regular
 tasks I perform. I really enjoy getting down in the weeds with big data sets and being able to extract information that is 
used to solve complex problems.</p>
