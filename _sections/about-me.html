<p>
I earned my bachelor's degree in Geography with a concentration in Geographic Information Systems from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 2018, 
graduating with honors (summa cum laude). Following graduation, I secured a position as a Transportation Planner at the Piedmont Authority for Regional Transportation.

During the day, I devoted my time to my job, while in the evenings, I pursued a Master's degree in Business Analytics, which I completed in 2021 at the University of 
North Carolina at Wilmington. After earning my Master's degree, I embarked on a career at Truist Financial, where I currently serve as an MSR Quantitative Analyst. In this role,
I play a crucial part in managing the interest rate risk for a vast portfolio of over 1 million mortgages held by the bank.

One of my key contributions has been streamlining our daily and monthly production processes through the implementation of Python and VBS scripting. In addition to my professional
pursuits, I have a passion for staying active through exercise, enjoying a round of golf, and delving into books. My wife and I have also made it a priority to travel more, and our
most recent adventure was a 2,000-mile road trip through the northeastern United States during the fall of 2023.
