<p>
    I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 2018 summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a
    concentration in Geographic Information Systems. I work as a Transportation Planner with the Piedmont Authority for
    Regional Transportation (PART). My work focuses on data analysis and visualization using GIS and various dashboards.
    I've recently been working with Python to automate my data cleaning and analysis. There's nothing better than
    getting down in the weeds with spatial data sets and being able to see what others cannot to solve an issue. I was recently
    accepted into an MS program at University of North Carolina at Wilmington for Business Analytics.
