<p>I recently married my long-time girlfriend in December 2018. We live in Winston-Salem, North Carolina with our dog, Cass.
He's a nine year old Papillon that I personify into our little child. In May 2018, I graduated from the University of North 
Carolina at Greensboro summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a concentration in Geographic Information Systems.
I currently work as a Transportation Planner. Most of my work focuses on data analysis and visualization using GIS as well as a
few nifty tools I've put together in Excel. I'm been working with Python to help with my data analysis. I really enjoy getting
down in the weeds with big data sets and being able to extract information that is used to solve an issue. I'm quick to adapt to
new environments and I am capable of managing projects and delivering results on time.</p>
