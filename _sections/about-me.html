<p>I recently married my long-time girlfriend in December 2018. We live in Winston-Salem, North Carolina with your dog, Cass.
He's a nine year old Papillon that I personify into our little child. In May 2018, I graduated from the University of North 
Carolina at Greensboro summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a concentration in Geographic Information Systems.</p>
