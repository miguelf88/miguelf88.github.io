<p>
    I received my Bachelor's Degree from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro in 2018 summa cum laude with a degree in Geography and a
    concentration in Geographic Information Systems. After graduation I obtained a job as a Transportation Planner with the Piedmont Authority for Regional 
    Transportation. During the day I went to work and in the evenings, I worked on a Master's degree in Business Analytics. In 2021, I graduated from the Univeristy of North Carolina at Wilmington.
    After I graduated with my Master's, I began working at Truist Financial as an MSR Quantitative Analyst. The bank services over 1 million mortgages and our team is responsible for managing the interest rate
    risk for that portfolio of mortgages. In this role, I have been able to create efficiencies in daily/monthly production processes using Python and VBS scripting.  When I'm not working, I enjoy exercising,
    playing golf, and reading. My wife and I have also been trying to travel more. Our latest excursion was a 2,000 mile roadtrip through the northeast United States in the fall of 2023.
